# State-of-Health-of-Li-ion-Batteries-in-EV
As the demand for sustainable urban transportation grows rapidly, reliable battery management becomes essential and crucial to ensure safety, efficiency, and longevity of electric vehicles (EVs). This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to accurately estimate the state-of-health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries in EVs and deployed it through an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring. The project adopted the CRISP-DM methodology, starting with robust data preprocessing to handle issues such as missing values and outliers, followed by exploratory data analysis to uncover key insights into battery degradation patterns. Four machine learning models which are Decision Tree, XGBoost, LSTM, and BiLSTM were developed and evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE. The tuned XGBoost model is the best performer due to its superior accuracy and generalization capabilities. A Streamlit dashboard was developed to deploy the model which allow users to input battery parameters and predict SOH and visualize trends in real-time. The project addresses limitations in existing studies such as lack of generalizability and data quality issues. This project is contributing to Sustainable Development Goal 11.2 by promoting safe, accessible, and sustainable transport systems.
